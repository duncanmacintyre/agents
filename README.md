# Agents

These are some text files to initialize the persona of an AI agent. For example, one of these files could be adapted to become the `AGENTS.md` for Codex or the `GEMINI.md` for gemini-cli. They could also be used as the basis for a prompt. They are intended to be used with agent software that can execute shell commands, not chatbots like the web versions of ChatGPT or Claude, though they may have some utility even there.

File | Agent Description
